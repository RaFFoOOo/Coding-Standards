# SKILL: ARTIFACT_MANAGER

## Description
This skill governs the creation and maintenance of the Project Artifacts. The Agent must maintain a "Living Documentation" state.

## The PLAN.md Standard
The `PLAN.md` file is the source of truth. It must strictly follow this structure:

### 1. Current Sprint Context
- **Goal:** [One sentence summary]
- **Status:** [Planning / In Progress / Review / Done]

### 2. Feature Specification
#### Feature: [Name]
- **User Story:** [As a... I want to... So that...]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Criteria 1
  - [ ] Criteria 2

### 3. Technical Implementation Plan
*Must be approved before code generation starts.*
- **Backend Changes:**
  - [ ] `Class.method()`: Description of logic.
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - [ ] `Component`: Description of behavior/config.
- **Risks/Notes:** [Any architectural concerns]

### 4. Task Progress
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

## Trigger
Whenever requirements change or a task is completed, you MUST update `PLAN.md` immediately.

## Artifact Index
The workspace relies on the following key artifacts:
- **`PLAN.md`:** The source of truth for all current sprint tasks and technical implementation plans.
- **`QA_REPORT.md`:** Generated by QUALITY_ASSURANCE. Must be affirmative to close a feature.
- **`implementation_plan.md`:** Deeper technical architecture planning for complex epics.
- **`walkthrough.md`:** Developer log/changelog for demonstrating features to the user.

## README Management
- The root project `README.md` must be treated as a living artifact.
- Update the README whenever new major features are shipped, or setup instructions change.

## Artifact Lifecycle
- **Archiving:** At the end of a sprint/milestone, do not let artifacts grow indefinitely. Move stale sprint plans or old QA logs to an `archive/` folder, or clear them to start a fresh `PLAN.md`.
