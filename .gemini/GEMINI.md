# GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

## 1. Planning & Process
- **Context Integrity:** Before starting any new Feature or major Refactor, explicitly verify you are referencing the latest versions of `GEMINI.md`, Local Rules (e.g., `stack-angular.md`), and Active Skills.
- **Task Granularity:** If a User Prompt is complex, multi-faceted, or "heavy":
  - **Do NOT** attempt to execute it in a single turn.
  - **Split** the prompt into smaller, sequential entries in `PLAN.md`.
  - Execute them one by one.
- **Artifact Generation:** Before implementing any feature, generate a `PLAN.md`.
- **Review Protocol:** Do not implement the plan until explicitly approved by the User.
- **Mandatory QA Gate:** No task can be marked as `[x]` in `PLAN.md` without a corresponding affirmative `QA_REPORT.md` generated by the `QUALITY_ASSURANCE` skill.

## 2. Code Quality & Structure
- **Access Modifiers:**
  - `public`: Only for external consumers.
  - `protected`: For inheritance chains.
  - `private`: For all internal logic.
- **The "Clean Surface" Rule:** A public method acts as a gateway. It should validate inputs and delegate work to private methods. It must NOT call other public methods within the same instance.
- **Zero Redundancy (DRY):** Never repeat logic. Extract to private methods or static utilities.
- **Immutability Strategy:**
  - Variables that are not intended to change must be explicitly locked.
  - Use `const` (JS/TS/C# locals) or `readonly` (C# fields) by default.
- **Modernity & Efficiency:**
  - **Deprecation Zero-Tolerance:** Never use deprecated methods or libraries. Check the latest LTS documentation before implementation.
  - **Standard-Compliant Performance:** Always prefer the native, modern idiom over legacy workarounds (e.g., use `Span<T>` in C# for slicing, use `Signals` in Angular for reactivity where appropriate). Maximize efficiency using the language's latest standard features.
- **Method Size:** Optimize for readability. A method should fit on a standard screen (approx. 20-30 lines).

## 3. Reliability & Security
- **Exception Safety:** All external calls (DB, API, File) must be wrapped in error handling blocks that fail gracefully.
- **Config Separation:** Never hardcode secrets or magic numbers. Use Constants classes or Environment Variables.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are mandatory for all business logic, covering Happy Path, Edge Cases, and Null Inputs.

## 4. Operational Protocols
- **The "Watchdog" Rule:**
  - If a CLI command (e.g., build, install, test) appears stuck or takes abnormally long:
  - **STOP** the agent/process immediately.
  - **Analyze** the last few lines of terminal output to find the root cause (e.g., network timeout, lockfile contention).
  - Do **not** blindly retry. Report the specific "Stuck Reason" to the User.
