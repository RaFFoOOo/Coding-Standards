# FRONTEND SPECIFICATIONS (Angular / TypeScript)

## 1. TypeScript Strictness
- **Type Safety:**
  - `strict: true` is mandatory.
  - **[ARCHITECT REQUIRED]** The `any` keyword is forbidden. If a type is unknown, use `unknown` and type-guard it, or create a `Generic<T>` interface.
- **Interfaces:** Define explicit interfaces for all input properties (`input()`), API responses, and Domain models.
- **[STRICT] Explicit Property Types:** Every class property (component or service) **MUST** carry an explicit type annotation — no reliance on TypeScript inference alone.
  - This applies to all `readonly` fields, injected service aliases, `computed()` signals, `toSignal()` results, and any other class-level declaration.
  - For Angular signals, always declare the full generic form: `Signal<T>`, `InputSignal<T>`, `WritableSignal<T>`, `ModelSignal<T>`.
  - ❌ `readonly isReady = computed(() => true)`
  - ✅ `readonly isReady: Signal<boolean> = computed(() => true)`
  - *Reason:* Inference is fragile across refactors. Explicit types serve as living documentation and catch type drift early at the declaration site.

## 2. Component Architecture (The "Building Block" Strategy)
- **Smart vs. Dumb Components:**
  - **Dumb (Presentation):** Receive data via `input()` / `model()`, emit actions via `output()`. No dependency on API Services.
  - **Smart (Container):** Orchestrate data fetching and pass it down to Dumb components.
- **Config-Driven UI:**
  - Complex components (Tables, Forms) must accept a `Config` object (e.g., `TableColumnDefinition[]`) rather than hardcoded HTML structures.
- **Performance:**
  - **Change Detection:** Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` by default for all components to maximize rendering efficiency.
  - **Parallel Loading:** When a page needs multiple data sources, use `forkJoin` (RxJS) to load them in parallel. Never chain independent subscriptions (Waterfall effect).
- **Visual Performance:** Avoid Layout thrashing. Use `CSS` transitions instead of JS animations where possible.

## 2a. Modern Angular Standards [STRICT]
- **Dependency Injection:**
  - **MUST** use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection for all services and tokens.
  - **Strict Interface Tokens:** When providing a concrete Mock class mapping to an abstract interface token in `app.config.ts`, components **MUST** strictly invoke `inject(ITokenInterface)`, never the concrete class directly.
  - **Ambient Provider Ban:** Concrete Mock classes intentionally bound within `app.config.ts` providers MUST NOT declare `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`. This forces explicit dependency resolution failures over silent uninitialized dual-instantiations if developers accidentally breach token mappings.
- **[STRICT] Service Decoupling from Templates:**
  - Injected services **MUST** always be declared `private`. Templates must never call service methods or access service signals directly (e.g., `myService.someSignal()` in HTML is forbidden).
  - Expose named `readonly` component properties (computed signals or direct signal aliases) that delegate to the service internally. Templates bind only to component properties.
  - ❌ `[value]="myService.someSignal()"` in template
  - ✅ `readonly someValue = this.myService.someSignal;` in component, then `[value]="someValue()"` in template
  - *Reason:* Decouples the template from the service's API shape. Renaming or refactoring a service requires updating only the component class, not the template.
- **Control Flow:**
  - **MUST** use the new Control Flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of legacy directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
- **File Structure:**
  - **Inline Templates/Styles forbidden:** Components must have separate `.html` and `.scss` files unless they display static text < 3 lines.
- **Standalone Components:** All components must be `standalone: true`.
- **Template Purity:**
  - **No Inline Logic:** Direct property assignment or Signal mutation in templates is forbidden.
    - ❌ `(click)="isOpen = false"` 
    - ❌ `(click)="isOpen.set(false)"`
  - **Explicit Handlers:** Always invoke a dedicated method that encapsulates the logic.
    - ✅ `(click)="closeDropdown()"` where method contains `this.isOpen.set(false)`

## 3. Data Service & Mocking Strategy
- **Offline Capability:**
  - **[ARCHITECT REQUIRED]** Every API Service (e.g., `BookingService`) must have a corresponding `MockBookingService`.
  - Use Angular's `environment` flag (`useMocks: true/false`) to switch the provider at the module level.
  - Mock services must return synthetic data with realistic delays (using `delay()` operator) to simulate network latency.
- **Local Environment Secure Mocking:**
  - Mock configuration payloads tracked in version control (e.g., `app-config.json`) **MUST NEVER** contain hardcoded secrets or SAS tokens.
  - To mock backend-level secure payload injections natively during local development, the consuming Mock Service MUST intercept the parsed JSON structure and dynamically merge active secrets isolated securely within `environment.development.ts` into the configuration state prior to distribution.

## 4. Assets & Internationalization
- **Text Content:**
  - No hardcoded text in HTML.
  - Use a centralized translation/label file (JSON or Constant Object) to separate content from structure.
- **Styling:**
  - Use CSS Variables (`var(--primary)`) defined in a global theme file (e.g., `_theme-variables.scss`).
  - **[BEST PRACTICE] Dual Token Pattern for Alpha Transparency:** When defining a theme color, always provide both the hex token and a companion `-rgb` token (e.g., `--primary: #79C1B0; --primary-rgb: 121, 193, 176;`). This enables `rgba(var(--primary-rgb), <alpha>)` without preprocessor functions.
  - **[BEST PRACTICE] Centralized Responsive Variables:** Layout constants (e.g., `--section-padding`, `--section-title-size`) must be defined globally and remapped within a global media query.
    - *Component usage:* Use the context variable `var(--section-padding)` directly.
    - *Benefit:* Avoids clashing/redundant media queries in feature-level SCSS files and maintains a DRY codebase.
  - Never use `!important`. Fix the specificity hierarchy instead.
  - **[STRICT] Component Style Budget:** Angular enforces a per-component CSS budget (`anyComponentStyle`). Before adding styles to any component SCSS file or its partials loaded via `@use`, assess the cumulative size.
    - **Shared visual styles** (colors, transitions, borders, typography) that apply to a base element across multiple partials (e.g., grid, list) MUST be defined once in the root component SCSS file. Partials must contain layout-only overrides (sizing, spacing, flex/grid context).
    - **Never duplicate** a style block across two or more partials loaded by the same component — duplication is the primary cause of budget breaches.
    - *Why:* `@use`-imported partial files are bundled into the host component's output CSS. Duplicated rules across partials sum directly against the component's budget.
- **Iconography:**
  - **Strict Ban on Textual Icons:** Never use text characters (e.g., "x", "<", ">", "+") to represent UI controls or icons.
  - **System Alignment:** Use a professional icon library aligned with the chosen Design System (e.g., FontAwesome, Material Icons, Bootstrap Icons).
  - **Implementation:** Render icons using the framework's dedicated component (e.g., `<fa-icon>`, `<mat-icon>`) or optimized SVGs.

## 5. Debugging & Reliability
- **Error Interception:**
  - Implement a global `HttpInterceptor` to catch errors.
  - Log errors to the console with specific "Reproduction Steps":
    `console.error("Context: [BookingForm]", "Input:", inputData, "Error:", error);`

## 6. Memory Safety & Subscriptions
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Use `takeUntilDestroyed()` on all manual RxJS subscriptions.
- **Declarative over Imperative:** Always prefer the `async` pipe or the `toSignal()` function over manually calling `.subscribe()`.
- **Subscription Ban:** It is strictly forbidden to use `.subscribe()` without an explicit cleanup strategy (e.g. `takeUntilDestroyed`, `DestroyRef`, or async pipe).
- **Route Param Signals [STRICT]:** Never derive a reactive signal from route params by calling `.subscribe()` and invoking `.set()` inside the callback. Always use `toSignal()` at the class field level:
  ```typescript
  // ✅ Correct
  readonly catalogType = toSignal(
    this.route.paramMap.pipe(map(params => params.get('catalogType') ?? '')),
    { initialValue: '' }
  );

  // ❌ Wrong — sets a signal inside a subscription
  readonly catalogType = signal('');
  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => this.catalogType.set(params.get('catalogType') ?? ''));
  }
  ```
  *Reason:* `toSignal()` is cleanup-free (tied to the injection context), propagates reactively, and avoids splitting state across field declaration and `ngOnInit`.

## 7. Reactive State Management
- **Local State:** Use `signal()` for all mutable component local state.
- **Derived State:** Use `computed()` for values derived from other signals.
- **Side Effects:** Use `effect()` strictly for side-effects (e.g., syncing to local storage, logging, external DOM manipulation) and never for state derivation.
- **Component API:** Use `input()`, `output()`, and `model()` for component communication.
- **Derived overrides:** Use `linkedSignal()` when you need state that is derived from props/inputs but can also be explicitly overridden by the user.

## 8. File & Folder Structure
- **Feature Modules:** Organize code by business feature rather than technical type (e.g., `features/auth/` containing its own components, services, models).
- **Naming Convention:** All Angular files must follow standard `kebab-case` naming (e.g., `user-profile.component.ts`).
- **Barrel Exports:** Use `index.ts` files inside feature folders to explicitly expose only the public API of that feature, preventing deep imports.

## 9. Multi-Tenant Architecture [STRICT]
- **Resource Resolution:**
  - **MUST** resolve all brand-specific brand assets (logos, favicons, primary images) dynamically via the `ITenantConfigService.getResourceUrl()` pattern.
  - Hardcoded paths to tenant assets in the `assets/` directory are forbidden for multi-tenant features.
- **Data Segregation:**
  - **MUST** use tenant-segregated keys for all browser-side persistence (localStorage, sessionStorage).
  - Implementation: Keys must be prefixed with a unique tenant identifier (e.g., `lc_{tenantId}_{key}`).
- **Mode-Aware UI:**
  - Standard components (Booking, Catalog) must adapt their behavior and terminology based on the `businessType` signal from `ITenantConfigService` to support diverse business models (e.g., Reservation vs. Order).
- **Mode Logic Centralization [STRICT]:**
  - When a config value drives conditional behavior across multiple components (e.g., a `businessType`, `userRole`, or `featureFlag`), create a dedicated injectable service that exposes named boolean signals and config methods derived from that value.
  - Direct string comparisons against config values (e.g., `config.type === 'x'`) are **forbidden** in components and templates. Components consume named signals from the centralized service instead.
  - Config methods on the service (e.g., `getDatePickerConfig()`, `getFormValidators()`) return typed config objects — templates bind to their properties rather than containing inline conditional expressions.
  - *Reason:* Adding or renaming a mode value only requires updating the centralized service, not auditing every component. Templates remain declarative and free of domain string literals.
